Building inverted pendulums.

Objective: to build an inverted pendulum that is actuated by strings. 
Important to notice that thee strings can only pull but not push. 
To see current state of the project run “Inverted_pendulum_tendon_actuation.py” in 
the folder “Inverted_pendulum_tendon_actuation”

Issues: In “Inverted_pendulum_tendon_actuation.py” I want to join a child link 
(i.e. Link #10), to the base link (i.e. link #-1). This is generating discrepancies when trying to run the simulation.
